Node is missing from the SYSTEM PATH, try this in your command line

SET PATH=C:\Program Files\Nodejs;%PATH%
and then try running node

To set this system wide you need to set in the system settings - cf - http://banagale.com/changing-your-system-path-in-windows-vista.htm

To be very clean, create a new system variable NODEJS

NODEJS="C:\Program Files\Nodejs"
Then edit the PATH in system variables and add %NODEJS%

PATH=%NODEJS%;...
